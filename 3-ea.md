# Week 3 - Evolutionary Algorithms
- insipired by biological evolution
- lifeforms adapt to a particular environment over generations
- combination of traits that are betterr adapted tend to increase representation in population
- can be mimicked to solve complex problems
> Variation ~ Crossover, Mutation

> Selection ~ Survival of the fittest

## Two competing forces
- _increasing_ population _diversity_ by mutation, recombination ~> **novelty**
- _decreasing_ population _diversity_ by selection of parents/survivors ~> **quality**

## Terms
**Gene** - one element of an array

**Locus** - position of a gene

**Allele** - 0 or 1 - what value a gene can have

**Genotype** - set of gene values

**Phenotype** - what could be built/developed based on the genotype
